# Zero Server Buildpack for Heroku

This is a Heroku buildpack for [Zero](https://github.com/remoteinterview/zero). This makes it easier to deploy Zero apps on heroku.

## How to use
- Create a new app on [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).
- Head over to Settings of that app.
- Under Buildpack setting, click **Add Buildpack**.
- Paste `https://github.com/remoteinterview/zero-heroku-buildpack` and click **Save**.
- Now you can push the Zero app to Heroku without making any changes and it will be built and served just fine.
